# rVPM based Simulation codes for Flapping Wings: LTF
The flowunsteady rVPM model source codes, are redefined for capturing the aerodynamic forces from a flapping wing precisely. This also involves modelling the flow around and trailing the wing. Accurate capture of LEVs and TEVs require new definitions in VLM and VPM methods. The data of flapping wing captured using High-speed cameras in-house are used for the pseudo-two-way FSI simulations. This simulation is run in variable fidelities and validated. This is part of the Learn-To-Fly (LTF) project funded by the DRDO.

Eg. Well-defined modular code for the flapping of a dragonfly, a mid-fidelity simulation. 
The simulation took 4 hrs for running 1500 steps in a 12-core CPU intel-i5 64bit.
